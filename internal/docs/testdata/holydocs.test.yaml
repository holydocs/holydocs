        ### Design Principles
        - **Event-driven architecture**: Services communicate through async message queues
        - **Microservices with clear boundaries**: Each service has a single responsibility
        - **Async communication**: All inter-service communication is asynchronous
        - **Data-driven insights**: Analytics service provides real-time insights and reporting
        
        ### Technology Stack
        - **Message Queues**: AsyncAPI for event-driven communication
        - **Databases**: ClickHouse for analytics, PostgreSQL for transactional data
        - **External Services**: SendGrid for email, Firebase for push notifications
        - **Monitoring**: Built-in analytics and reporting capabilities
